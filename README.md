[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a Book Catalog web MVC application developed with Springboot2, along with Thymeleaf, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) and H2 in-memory database (easily extendable to use any other DBMS). Stereotype annotations used: @Controller, @RequestMapping, @Autowired (implicitly), @Repository (implicitly) and persistence annotations: @Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue, @Column, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany, @JoinColumn, @JoinTable, @Query. For more info, read the project comments at each class, starting from the @SpringBootApplication Main class.

This repository is a single-project repo with Git version control.

Some of my repositories are for backup only, each of them being a collection of tens of projects inside one same repo (with no individual version control for each project), and others are single-project repositores (with effective version control for that single project). As a distinction between them, the backup repos are named in uppercase with underscores (e.g. SPRING3) while the single-project ones are named in lowercase with dashes (e.g. springboot2-ac-di).
